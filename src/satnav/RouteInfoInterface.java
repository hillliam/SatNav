   * only displayed once.  For example, if the underlying route were to suggest:
   *   Furnival Street -> Furnival Street -> Furnival Street -> Furnival Square -> ...
   * Furnival Street is only displayed once, thus making the output appear like:
   *   Furnival Street -> Furnival Square -> ...
   * Note, this behaviour is only if the labels are repeated one after another and
   * not if the same street name appears later in the route having been split by other
   * street names

   * if incvertices is true, you should also include the vertex numbers
   *
   * When incvertices is false, a suggested return format for this method would be:
   *   Furnival Street -> Furnival Square -> Arundel Gate -> Norfolk Street
   * and when incvertices is true, the return might look a little like:
   *   (498)Furnival Street (1958, 1776) -> Furnival Square (1109, 386, 405, 425) -> Arundel Gate (371, 3073, 1762, 3071, 2599, 2617, 462) -> Norfolk Street (669, 472, 1143)
   * note that the numbers in the brackets indicate the vertex ids and more than one 
   * number means that edge labels would have been repeated if not removed)
   * 
   * @param incvertices true when vertex ids should be included in the returned string
   * @return String giving the path calculated by the route planning algorithm defined by the edges traversed
